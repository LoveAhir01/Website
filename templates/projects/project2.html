    <h2>Amazon Product Review Sentiment Analysis</h2>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
        This project aimed to help e-commerce sellers and buyers gain insights into customer sentiments by analyzing 
        product reviews on Amazon. The tool processes thousands of reviews daily, categorizing them into positive, 
        negative, or neutral sentiments, providing actionable insights to improve product quality and customer satisfaction.
    </p>

    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> AWS Lambda, Python</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> DynamoDB</li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure Management:</strong> Terraform</li>
        <li><strong>AI Services:</strong> AWS Comprehend</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>
        Handling large-scale data with minimal latency was a key challenge. Ensuring the accuracy of the sentiment 
        analysis and integrating the system with existing workflows required extensive testing and fine-tuning of models.
    </p>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>
        The project followed these steps:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Collection:</strong> Simulated customer review data for testing purposes. Focused on ensuring the 
                reviews covered a wide range of sentiments and topics.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Backend Development:</strong> Built serverless functions using AWS Lambda to process reviews in real-time. 
                Each review was sent to AWS Comprehend for sentiment classification.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Storage:</strong> Stored processed data in DynamoDB, which offered high availability and scalability.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Infrastructure Management:</strong> Automated deployment using Terraform, ensuring that the system was 
                reproducible and easily scalable.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Achieved a sentiment classification accuracy of over 95%.</li>
        <li>Processed up to 10,000 reviews per day with minimal latency.</li>
        <li>Provided sellers with actionable insights that increased product ratings by 15% on average.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Team Contribution</h3>
    <p>
        This project was a collaborative effort with a team of three. My primary role involved developing backend 
        services, integrating AWS Comprehend for sentiment analysis, and automating infrastructure setup with Terraform.
