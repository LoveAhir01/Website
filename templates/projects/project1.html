    <h2>University Management System</h2>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
        The University Management System was developed to streamline and digitize student record management processes 
        in educational institutions. The goal was to replace manual, paper-based systems with a secure, efficient, and 
        centralized platform that could handle student records, attendance tracking, and performance evaluations.
    </p>

    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Java, Spring Boot, Maven</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL</li>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>
        One of the significant challenges was ensuring the security and integrity of student data while allowing 
        administrators and faculty to access it seamlessly. Additionally, integrating multiple modules like attendance 
        tracking and grading posed a technical challenge, requiring robust database design and modular coding practices.
    </p>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>
        The project was developed in the following phases:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Requirement Analysis:</strong> Identified the key functionalities needed for managing student records, 
                such as secure data storage, attendance tracking, and performance evaluations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Design:</strong> Created UML diagrams and entity-relationship (ER) models to structure the database 
                and define relationships between entities like students, courses, and faculty.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Implementation:</strong> Developed the backend using <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Spring Boot</strong>. 
                Modularized the application to allow scalability, ensuring that new features could be added without affecting 
                existing modules.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Testing:</strong> Conducted unit and integration tests to validate the systemâ€™s functionality and 
                ensure data consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Deployment:</strong> Deployed the system on a local server for testing and feedback.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved record management efficiency by 80%.</li>
        <li>Reduced administrative workload by automating repetitive tasks.</li>
        <li>Enhanced data accuracy and minimized errors in record handling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Team Contribution</h3>
    <p>
        This was an individual project where I designed, implemented, and tested the entire system from scratch. It provided 
        me with a deep understanding of software design principles, database management, and backend development.
