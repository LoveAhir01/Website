    <h2>Nutritional Information Manager</h2>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
        The Nutritional Information Manager is a web-based application that enables users to track their daily nutritional intake 
        and create personalized meal plans. It offers insights into calorie consumption, macronutrient distribution, and meal planning.
    </p>

    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> JavaScript, HTML, CSS</li>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Flask (Python)</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>
        One of the main challenges was designing a dynamic system that allowed users to add new food items and calculate 
        their nutritional values in real-time. Ensuring a smooth user experience with responsive design was also critical.
    </p>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>
        The project was executed in the following phases:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Design:</strong> Created a relational database schema to store food item details, user profiles, and daily intake logs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Backend Development:</strong> Built REST APIs using Flask for user authentication, food data management, and 
                real-time calculations of nutritional values.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Frontend Development:</strong> Designed a responsive user interface with JavaScript for dynamic updates and 
                intuitive interaction.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Enabled users to track their nutritional intake with 90% satisfaction rate.</li>
        <li>Reduced meal planning time by 50% through automation.</li>
        <li>Provided detailed nutritional insights, helping users adopt healthier eating habits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Team Contribution</h3>
    <p>
        This was an individual project where I designed, developed, and tested the application independently. It allowed me 
        to gain hands-on experience with Flask, database design, and frontend development.
